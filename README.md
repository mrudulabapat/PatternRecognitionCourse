The following is the gist of all the assignments from the Pattern recognition course studied:

Assignments/HW1 : Image processing, manipulation was understood using PIL(Python Imaging Library).

Assignments/HW2 : Deep Neural network built on Las Vegas Metroploitan police department dataset to study the different crime patterns. 

Assignments/HW3 : An autoencoder was trained on images of human faces using Pytorch and the original image and the reconstructed image was compared.

Assignments/HW4 : A variational autoencoder for a human face dataset was built using Pytorch. The difference between an autoencoder and a variational autoencoder was studied.
